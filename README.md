# python-faker-miner

## TL;DR;

This is used to fake mining operations by just consuming CPU, and potentially GPU down the road. It can be used for simulating digitial coin mining for a lab where real coin miner may violate a policy or two.

## Usage:

Download the script, rename it if needed, then execute it with `python3 faker_miner.py`


## Credit:

The initial inspiration for the script came from: https://qxf2.com/blog/generate-cpu-load/. This is just an adaptation for generating cpu load for incident response labs.
